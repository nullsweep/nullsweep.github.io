title: "Generate Nmap HTML Reports with Bash"
---

As a researcher that does a lot of ctf's and recon in general, my workflow often involves scanning and documenting target environments quickly and efficiently. Since **Nmap** is of course my go to tool for initial recon, I want to beautify it's raw output to share with others.

So I threw together a simple Bash script to streamline this process. It performs a scan against your target and instantly produces an HTML report. Manually converting Nmap XML to HTML using `xsltproc` isnâ€™t hard, but doing it repeatedly across targets gets tedious.

Example report:

If you want to use or improve the script yourself, you can grab it here:
