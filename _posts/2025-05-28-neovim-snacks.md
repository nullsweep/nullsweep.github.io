title: "Set up Neovim + Snacks! Dotfiles included."
---

I've recently been working to join the nvim elite and never touch a mouse again. I have found this game to really help get you going, after a few hours of these levels, I was already feeling pretty confident using vim. After that I wanted to customize it and make it look and feel like my own personal space, similar to how I have done with hyprland and regolith recently. Below I am going to walk through the set up for both lazy.nvim and snacks.nvim: 

First is to install the most important piece, and that is, of course, neovim:
```
# Debian
sudo apt-get install neovim
```
Next we want to configure lazy.nvim and make sure it is functional. WIP
