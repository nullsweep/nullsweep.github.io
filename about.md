Cameron White, security engineer focused in red teaming, ethical hacking, signal hunting, and developing/improving tools for all of the above.

Professionally I work across roles in security operations, engineering, and automation. My day involves building and maintaining systems that manage access for thousands of users.

When I have time away from access policies or building internal tools, I will be sharing writeups here on specialized tools, RF/Microwave research, bug bounties, CTF walkthroughs, or whatever mini project I’ve been obsessing over that week.
